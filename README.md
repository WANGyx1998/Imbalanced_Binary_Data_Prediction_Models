# Imbalanced_Binary_Data_Prediction_Models
This project focuses on developing predictive models for binary classification and regression tasks using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. A key emphasis is placed on addressing challenges associated with imbalanced datasets to enhance model performance and reliability.
